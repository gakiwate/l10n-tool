Explanation of scripts and files

==================
list.lang
==================
This is a text file. The languages that you want to work with. 

It is important to note that because the files created from this will be further used by Moses
it is important to get the language codes right. Because Moses does not distinguish between 
en-US, en-UK etc.

<lang> will be listed in list.lang

You can download the cache files from the following link
http://transvision.mozfr.org/TMX/show.php?repo=release&locale=fr&cache=en-US

You can make suitable changes to the link above to download from and locale of the cache file you want to download.

A shell script will be put up shortly to help you download.

==================
cache2parallel.py
==================
This script is used to convert the php cache files. It uses the lang.list in the same folder
to find all the php cache files and convert them to parallel corpora. The parallel corpora will
be stored in ~/corpus.

It is important to note that because the files created from this will be further used by Moses
it is important to get the language codes right. Because Moses does not distinguish between 
en-US, en-UK etc. we have to make sure the naming is cache_en.php
The naming format cache_<lang>.php

<lang> will be listed in list.lang

To Run:
	python cache2parallel.py

NOTE:
	It is assumed that the lang.list and the php cache files are loacted in the same folder as that of the script.

==================
tune-corpus.py
==================
There are times when you would like to clean up the parallel corpus. Especially when you have only limted strings translated in the corpus. This script will go through your corpus and make sure that 
====================
create_lex_tables.sh
====================
This is a bash script that takes in the parallel corpora and outputs lex files to
	~/lex-dir

This assumes that you have installed Moses, GIZA, IRSTLM as instructed in the Instructions.

To Run:
	bash create_lex_tables.sh

NOTE:
	It is assumed that lang.list is located in the same folder.
	Make sure the parallel corpus is created before running this script.
