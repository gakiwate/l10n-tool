=====================
Baseline Installation
=====================
This set of Instructions will deal with the setting up of a Baseline System on a Linux System.

The minimum software requirements are:
1. Moses
2. GIZA++
3. IRSTLM

------------------
Moses Installation
------------------

Dependencies
------------
1. Install boost
Moses requires boost. Most of the linux distributions have a package for it. If your distribution has
separate development packages, you need to install those too. Ubuntu requires "libboost-all-dev"

2. Other than that Moses requires quite a few other software. While Moses does not require them during compile time but during runtime it will spew out errors and you will have no idea why. In this case we have no option but to wade through the errors. Listed below are packages/libraries that I faced a problem with and you should make sure you have them installed before going ahead with the installation.
	a. zlib* - Compression Libraries
	b. automake libraries

Installation
-------------
Ideally download the source in your home folder
1. Download Source for mosesdecoder
	git clone git://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder.git
2. Compile by
	cd ~/mosesdecoder
	./bjam
Note: You can build in parallel by 
	./bjam -j<num>
	<num> depends on number of cpus
For help:
	./bjam --help

-------------------
GIZA++ Installation
-------------------
GIZA++ is hosted at Google Code

1. Download and Extract 
	wget http://giza-pp.googlecode.com/files/giza-pp-v1.0.7.tar.gz
	tar xzvf giza-pp-v1.0.7.tar.gz
2. Compile
	cd giza-pp
	make

This should create the binaries ~/giza-pp/GIZA++-v2/GIZA++, ~/giza-pp/GIZA++-v2/snt2cooc.out
and ~/giza-pp/mkcls-v2/mkcls. 

These need to be copied to somewhere that Moses can find them as follows
	cd ~/mosesdecoder
	mkdir giza
	cp ~/giza-pp/GIZA++-v2/GIZA++ ~/giza-pp/GIZA++-v2/snt2cooc.out ~/giza-pp/mkcls-v2/mkcls giza

-------------------
IRSTLM Installation
-------------------
1. Download from sourceforge. Version 5.70.04
2. Extract 
	tar zxvf irstlm-5.70.04.tgz
	cd irstlm-5.70.04
3. Run Scripts
	./regenerate-makefiles.sh
	./configure --prefix=$HOME/irstlm
4. Compile and Install
	make
	make install

--------------------
Further Instructions
--------------------
Moses to link its scripts to GIZA++ and install them in the dist directory
This can be done with the following commands
	cd ~/mosesdecoder
	./bjam --with-giza=$HOME/mosesdecoder/giza --install-scripts=$HOME/mosesdecoder/dist

NOTE: You can also pass option --with-irstlm=$HOME/irstlm
